# SendScriptWhatsApp
Code to send the entire Bible script to your friends or WhatsApp groups

## How to use it
Open [bible_Script.js]([https://github.com/Matt-Fontes/SendScriptWhatsApp/blob/main/shrekSendScript.js](https://github.com/Dixter999/bible_script_WA/blob/main/Bible_Script.js))
ipt.js

Copy all the content (copy raw -> COPY RAW FILE)

In WhatsApp Web open the Browser console

|  ⚠️ Important notice, in a recent Google Chrome update, it is being prevented from pasting any script into the Console.
|--|
***To get around this problem, the developer console expects to receive a text confirmation by typing in the console: "allow-scripts"***|
|You will then be allowed to paste and continue executing the script|

Paste the code into the console and press Enter

Done
