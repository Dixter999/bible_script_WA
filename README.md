In WhatsApp Web open the Browser console

|  ⚠️ Important notice, in a recent Google Chrome update, it is being prevented from pasting any script into the Console.
|--|
***To get around this problem, the developer console expects to receive a text confirmation by typing in the console: "allow-scripts"***|
|You will then be allowed to paste and continue executing the script|

Paste the code into the console and press Enter

Done
